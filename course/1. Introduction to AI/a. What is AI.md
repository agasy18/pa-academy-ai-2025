# What is AI? What is Machine Learning?

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term encompasses a wide range of technologies and approaches that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

### Key Characteristics of AI:
1. **Problem Solving**: Ability to analyze complex situations and find solutions
2. **Learning**: Capability to acquire knowledge from experience
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying regularities and patterns in data
4. **Adaptation**: Adjusting behavior based on new information
5. **Decision Making**: Making choices based on available data

### Types of AI:

1. **Narrow/Weak AI**
   - Designed for specific tasks
   - Examples: Siri, chess programs, recommendation systems
   - Currently the most common form of AI

2. **General/Strong AI**
   - Hypothetical AI with human-like general intelligence
   - Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains
   - Currently does not exist

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and improve with experience. Instead of following explicitly programmed instructions, ML algorithms build mathematical models based on sample data (training data) to make predictions or decisions.

### Key Concepts in Machine Learning:

1. **Data**
   - The foundation of ML
   - Quality and quantity of data significantly impact performance
   - Types: structured, unstructured, semi-structured

2. **Features**
   - Input variables used for prediction
   - Can be raw data or engineered characteristics
   - Feature selection and engineering are crucial skills

3. **Models**
   - Mathematical representations that make predictions
   - Range from simple linear models to complex neural networks
   - Choice depends on problem type and data characteristics

4. **Training**
   - Process of learning from data
   - Involves optimizing model parameters
   - Requires balancing bias and variance

### The Machine Learning Pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathering relevant data
   - Ensuring data quality and quantity

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning data
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and normalization

3. **Model Selection**
   - Choosing appropriate algorithm
   - Setting hyperparameters

4. **Training**
   - Feeding data to the model
   - Adjusting parameters

5. **Evaluation**
   - Testing model performance
   - Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall

6. **Deployment**
   - Implementing model in production
   - Monitoring performance
