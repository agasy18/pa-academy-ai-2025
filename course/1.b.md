# Machine Learning Problems

Machine Learning encompasses various types of problems, each with its own characteristics, algorithms, and evaluation metrics. Here are the main categories:

## 1. Classification

Classification is the task of predicting discrete class labels for new instances based on past observations.

### Types of Classification:
1. **Binary Classification**
   - Two possible classes
   - Example: Spam detection (spam/not spam)
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees

2. **Multi-class Classification**
   - More than two classes
   - Example: Digit recognition (0-9)
   - Algorithms: Random Forests, Neural Networks

3. **Multi-label Classification**
   - Multiple labels per instance
   - Example: Image tagging (can be both "sunny" and "beach")
   - Algorithms: Modified versions of standard classifiers

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curve
- Confusion Matrix

## 2. Regression

Regression involves predicting continuous numerical values based on input features.

### Types of Regression:
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicts output based on linear relationship
   - Example: House price prediction
   - Variations: Simple, Multiple, Polynomial

2. **Non-linear Regression**
   - Captures non-linear relationships
   - Example: Stock price prediction
   - Methods: Neural Networks, SVR

### Key Concepts:
- Line/Curve of Best Fit
- Residuals
- Least Squares Method
- R-squared Value

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## 3. Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that groups similar instances together without predefined labels.

### Types of Clustering:
1. **Partitional Clustering**
   - Divides data into non-overlapping clusters
   - Example: K-means clustering
   - Applications: Customer segmentation

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Creates tree of clusters
   - Methods: Agglomerative, Divisive
   - Visualized through dendrograms

3. **Density-based Clustering**
   - Finds clusters based on density
   - Example: DBSCAN
   - Good for irregular shapes

### Key Considerations:
- Number of clusters
- Distance metrics
- Cluster shapes
- Outlier handling

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Calinski-Harabasz Index
- Within-cluster Sum of Squares

## 4. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

### Key Components:
1. **Agent**
   - The learner/decision maker
   - Has states and actions
   - Learns policy

2. **Environment**
   - Where agent operates
   - Provides rewards/penalties
   - Has transition dynamics

3. **Policy**
   - Strategy for choosing actions
   - Maps states to actions
   - Optimized through learning

### Types of RL:
1. **Model-based**
   - Agent learns model of environment
   - Plans using learned model
   - Example: AlphaGo

2. **Model-free**
   - Learns directly from experience
   - No explicit environment model
   - Example: Q-learning

### Common Algorithms:
1. **Value-based**
   - Q-Learning
   - Deep Q-Network (DQN)
   - SARSA

2. **Policy-based**
   - Policy Gradient
   - REINFORCE
   - Actor-Critic

### Applications:
1. **Games**
   - Chess
   - Go
   - Video games

2. **Robotics**
   - Navigation
   - Manipulation
   - Control

3. **Resource Management**
   - Network routing
   - Power systems
   - Inventory management
